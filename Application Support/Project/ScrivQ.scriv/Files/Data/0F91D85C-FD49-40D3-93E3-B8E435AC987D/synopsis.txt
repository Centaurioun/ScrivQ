Include an automatically generated table of contents (or, in the case of latex, context, docx, odt, opendocument, rst, or ms, an instruction to create one) in the output document. This option has no effect if standalone is false.

Note that if you are producing a PDF via ms, the table of contents will appear at the beginning of the document, before the title. If you would prefer it to be at the end of the document, use the option pdf-engine-opt: --no-toc-relocation.
