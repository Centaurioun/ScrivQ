        <Text>The ScrivQ template programs the Scrivener writing environment -- Compile Formats, Section Layouts, Section Types, Paragraph Styles, Character Styles, text templates with raw markup, and even the icons -- for publishing Quarto Books (PDF, DOCX, and HTML). It descends from Ian's excellent [Scrivomatic and Quarto template for Scrivener](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic), making use of a modified version of its original ruby script to perform additional tasks, such as repositioning parts of the markup (cross-references, footnotes), optionally adding and committing using the content from Git Commit, and splitting the text into the multiple files needed for a Quarto project -- such as the lua filters (_extensions), the project metadata (_quarto), and the bibliographies (Primary Sources, Secondary Sources, Workflow) (if they already exist in the system, they are overwritten; other files are not modified). The ScrivQ template should be able to compile with zero configuration if both Scrivener and Quarto are installed (for PDF, tinytex is also required*). To get the latest version of ScrivQ, make sure to download it from the releases section of the [Github repository](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/ScrivQ/releases).
