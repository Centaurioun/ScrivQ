Include line numbers in code block output (true or false).

For revealjs output only, you can also specify a string to highlight specific lines (and/or animate between sets of highlighted lines).

Sets of lines are denoted with commas:
3,4,5
1,10,12
Ranges can be denoted with dashes and combined with commas:
1-3,5
5-10,12,14
Finally, animation steps are separated by |:
1-3|1-3,5 first shows 1-3, then 1-3,5
|5|5-10,12 first shows no numbering, then 5, then lines 5-10 and 12
