LaTeX figure position arrangement to be used in \begin{figure}[].
Computational figure output that is accompanied by the code that produced it is given a default value of fig-pos="H" (so that the code and figure are not inordinately separated).
If fig-pos is false, then we donâ€™t use any figure position specifier, which is sometimes necessary with custom figure environments (such as sidewaysfigure).
