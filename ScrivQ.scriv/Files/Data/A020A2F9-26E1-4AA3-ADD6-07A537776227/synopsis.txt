Shift heading levels by a positive or negative integer. For example, with shift-heading-level-by: -1, level 2 headings become level 1 headings, and level 3 headings become level 2 headings. Headings cannot have a level less than 1, so a heading that would be shifted below level 1 becomes a regular paragraph. Exception: with a shift of -N, a level-N heading at the beginning of the document replaces the metadata title.
