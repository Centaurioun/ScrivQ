        <Text>This template makes extensive use of \&lt;$linkID&gt;, that is, the ID generated by Scrivener for each binder item at compile time. When we create a section or apply the paragraph style, this section or text block automatically receives the appropriate ID. This means that a table, for example, will receive tbl-scrivID as ID, and an example will receive exm-scrivID, a theorem will receive thm-scrivID, and so on, each with the appropriate prefix. 

Callouts (Caution, Important, Note, Tip, Warning) and Cross-reference Environments (Conjecture, Corollary, Definition, Example, Exercice, Lemma, Proposition, Theorem), along with others (Tables, Equations, Figures, Listings) can be created using Styles or with their own Section Types. </Text>
