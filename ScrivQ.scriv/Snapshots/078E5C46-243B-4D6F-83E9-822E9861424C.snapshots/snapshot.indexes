        <Text>Notice how simple and repetitive this strategy is. You don't have to remember abbreviations, rules, or anything. Just use scrivauto, link to the binder item that contains the element, pick the appropriate style. Done! Also, do you see anything odd about this footnote? Yes, we can use styles freely in footnotes! YEAH!</Text>
