Read metadata from the supplied YAML (or JSON) files. This option can be used with every input format, but string scalars in the YAML file will always be parsed as Markdown. Generally, the input will be handled the same as in YAML metadata blocks. Values in files specified later in the list will be preferred over those specified earlier. Metadata values specified inside the document, or by using -M, overwrite values specified with this option.
