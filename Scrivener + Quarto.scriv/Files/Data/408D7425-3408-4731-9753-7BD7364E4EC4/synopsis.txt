If you want Quarto to produce a LaTeX file (.tex) rather than a PDF (for example, if you want to do your own processing of the PDF) there are two ways to accomplish this: 
Use the latex format rather than the pdf format. For example:
format:
  latex:
    documentclass: report
    classoption: [twocolumn, landscape]
    lof: true
    lot: true
Use the pdf format along with the keep-tex option.
format:
  pdf:
    documentclass: report
    keep-tex: true
