# ScrivQ


The ScrivQ template adapts the [Scrivener ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://www.literatureandlatte.com) writing environment (i.e. Compile Formats, Section Layouts, Section Types, Paragraph Styles, and Character Styles) to easily export multiple files, handle bibliographies and cross-references, and build a complex YAML front-matter (with hundreds of built-in parameters) for outputting [Quarto ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) [Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) (PDF[1], DOCX, and HTML) that compile right away with zero configuration. Make sure to download it from the [releases section üöÄ](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/ScrivQ/releases) to get the latest version. You can take part in the ongoing discussion by joining us at the [forum üí¨](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/scrivq-a-template-to-control-quarto-export-multiple-files-manage-bibliography-and-easily-create-cross-references/134755) and you can show your appreciation by [sponsoring this project ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/sponsors/bcdavasconcelos).
