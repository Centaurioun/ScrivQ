# ScrivQ

ScrivQ adapts [Scrivener's ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://www.literatureandlatte.com) writing environment (i.e. _Compile Formats_, _Section Layouts_, _Section Types_, _Paragraph Styles_, and _Character Styles_) to easily export multiple files, handle bibliographies and cross-references, and build a complex YAML front-matter (with hundreds of built-in parameters) for outputting [Quarto ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) [Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) (PDF, DOCX, and HTML) that compile right away with zero configuration.

_Caveats_Ôøº
1. For PDF output, [tinytex](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html#installing-tex) is also required. 
2. You must install [Ruby ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads), if you are on Windows.
